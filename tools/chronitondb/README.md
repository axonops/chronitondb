# ChronitonDB code checks

Two checks for the Java files under `org/chronitondb` that a change adds or modifies. Apache code is never checked by either. Both run in the agent commit gate and in the CI workflow `.github/workflows/chronitondb-shape.yml` on every pull request into a `chronitondb-*` branch. Owner decisions M2 to M6 and G1 in the kit's DECISIONS.md.

## Shape limits: `shape-check.sh`

Measured limits on production code, every finding blocks:

| Limit | Value | Tool |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cyclomatic complexity per method (a `switch` counts once) | 10 | checkstyle CyclomaticComplexity |
| NPath complexity per method | 200 | checkstyle NPathComplexity |
| Boolean expression complexity | 3 operators | checkstyle BooleanExpressionComplexity |
| Method length (blank and comment lines included) | 80 lines | checkstyle MethodLength |
| Parameters per method | 7 | checkstyle ParameterNumber |
| Nested `if` depth | 3 | checkstyle NestedIfDepth |
| Nested loop depth (`for` loops, checkstyle has no module for `while`) | 2 | checkstyle NestedForDepth |
| Class fan out | 20 classes | checkstyle ClassFanOutComplexity |
| File length | 1,000 lines | checkstyle FileLength |
| Cognitive complexity per method | 15 | PMD CognitiveComplexity |
| Duplicated block | 50 tokens | PMD CPD |

Tests and benchmarks (any path with a `test/` directory before `org/chronitondb`: `test/unit`, `test/distributed`, `test/microbench`, `test/burn`) are measured with looser limits and every finding is a warning, never a failure: cyclomatic complexity 5, method length 150, file length 1,000, cognitive complexity 15, duplication 50 tokens. Testing a database is complicated, long setup is not a finding.

The rules live in `checkstyle-shape.xml` (production), `checkstyle-shape-tests.xml` (tests) and `pmd-ruleset.xml` (cognitive complexity, plus the CPD setting and the PMD pin). Changing a limit is a one line change there.

Output, one line per finding, then a summary:

    ERROR src/java/org/chronitondb/index/Foo.java:42:5 CyclomaticComplexity value=12 limit=10: Cyclomatic Complexity is 12 (max allowed is 10).
    WARN test/unit/org/chronitondb/index/FooTest.java:88:5 MethodLength value=162 limit=150: Method verify length is 162 lines (max allowed is 150).
    shape-check: 1 production finding(s) that block, 1 test warning(s), 1 production and 1 test file(s) checked

Exit 0 when nothing blocks, 1 on a production finding, 2 when the check could not run.

## Google Java Style: `format-check.sh`

ChronitonDB code follows Google Java Style, enforced with google-java-format. Production and test files alike, every unformatted file blocks, formatting has no legitimate exceptions.

    tools/chronitondb/format-check.sh src/java/org/chronitondb/index/Foo.java   report
    tools/chronitondb/format-check.sh --fix src/java/org/chronitondb/index/Foo.java   format in place

The `.editorconfig` at the repository root carries the matching editor settings (2 space indent, 100 columns) for `src/java/org/chronitondb/**` and `test/**/org/chronitondb/**` only. Other paths are not affected.

Apache's own checkstyle (`.build/checkstyle.xml` and `.build/checkstyle_test.xml`) runs over the whole tree. The 6.0 line enforces `ImportOrder` with Cassandra's groups and static imports at the bottom, which Google style contradicts (one ASCII sorted block, static imports first). So `.build/checkstyle_suppressions.xml`, which both configs read, carries one `ImportOrder` suppression for `org/chronitondb` paths, with a comment naming decision G1. `AvoidStarImport` stays on for ChronitonDB code, Google style forbids wildcard imports too. The 5.0 line has no `ImportOrder` rule and needs no suppression.

## Running

    tools/chronitondb/shape-check.sh FILE...            these files
    tools/chronitondb/shape-check.sh                    the staged files (what the commit gate does)
    tools/chronitondb/shape-check.sh --base origin/chronitondb-6.0   the files changed since the merge base (what CI does)
    tools/chronitondb/shape-check.sh --self-test        the fixtures under test/
    tools/chronitondb/format-check.sh ...               same options, plus --fix

Paths that are not `org/chronitondb/**/*.java` are ignored. Checkstyle comes from the build's own test classpath, `build/test/lib/jars`, so run `ant resolver-retrieve-build` (or any build) once. On 6.0 that target also builds the `modules/accord` submodule, so run `git submodule update --init` first. PMD and google-java-format are downloaded into `build/chronitondb-shape` on first use and refused unless their sha256 matches the pin. Nothing is added to `lib/` or `build.xml`, nothing is shipped, `build/` is not committed. `SHAPE_PMD_HOME` and `SHAPE_GJF_JAR` point at copies already on disk, for offline use.

Pins:

- checkstyle 10.26.1, the version Apache's build declares in `.build/parent-maven-pom.xml` on the 6.0 line.
- PMD 7.29.0, `pmd-dist-7.29.0-bin.zip` from the PMD GitHub release, sha256 recorded in `pmd-ruleset.xml` after the release signature verified against the PMD release signing key.
- google-java-format 1.37.0 all-deps jar from its GitHub release, sha256 recorded in `format-check.sh`, equal to the digest GitHub publishes for the asset and to Maven Central's `.sha256`. It needs a Java 21 JDK, so run `format-check.sh` with `JAVA_HOME` at 21, or `SHAPE_GJF_JAVA_HOME` pointing at a Java 21 JDK, even when the build uses 11 or 17 (`build.xml` supports 11, 17 and 21 on this line). The CI workflow runs on Temurin 21. The 5.0 line pins the same release.

## Tests

`test/src` and `test/test` hold one fixture per limit that breaks it and a few that pass (a 15 case `switch` with cyclomatic complexity 2, a method at cognitive complexity 15 exactly, a 100 line test method). `test/expected.txt` lists the finding each fixture must produce. `test/format` holds one formatted and one unformatted class. `--self-test` stages them as `src/java` and `test/unit` files, runs the real tools and compares. The fixtures are skipped when given to the checks by their own path, so staging them never fails a commit. CI runs both self-tests before the checks.

## Waivers

A production limit can be exceeded only with a waiver the owner recorded in the design record of the change, naming the method, the rule and why the shape is right there. A suppression comment in the code is not a waiver and the rules files have no suppression filter. The maintainability review lens reads the check output next to the design record and treats a broken limit without a recorded waiver as a major finding.

## Security checks

Two more checks, advisory until the owner makes them required (decision E13). CI runs them on every pull request into a `chronitondb-*` branch, in `.github/workflows/chronitondb-semgrep.yml` and `chronitondb-spotbugs.yml`, each after its self-test.

### Semgrep: `semgrep-check.sh`

Semgrep CE from its container image, pinned by digest in the script, run with docker without network. The rules are in `semgrep/`, one file per topic:

| File | Finds | Paths |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `banned-apis.yml` | the APIs `.build/checkstyle.xml` bans in main code | `src/java/org/chronitondb` |
| `non-ascii-identifiers.yml` | a non-ASCII character outside strings and comments | any `org/chronitondb` path |
| `process-exec.yml` | `Runtime.exec` and `ProcessBuilder` with a command that is not a string literal | every Java file |
| `deserialization.yml` | `ObjectInputStream` | every Java file |
| `bidi.yml` | Unicode bidirectional control characters | every file |

    tools/chronitondb/semgrep-check.sh FILE...          these files
    tools/chronitondb/semgrep-check.sh                  the staged files
    tools/chronitondb/semgrep-check.sh --base origin/chronitondb-5.0   the files changed since the merge base, without the findings already there (what CI does)
    tools/chronitondb/semgrep-check.sh --self-test      the fixtures under test/semgrep

Semgrep runs with `--disable-nosem`, so a `nosemgrep` comment hides nothing, and a checkstyle `permit` comment does not hide a banned API from Semgrep. Needs docker and jq. `--self-test` runs `semgrep --test` on `test/semgrep` (each `ruleid` line must be reported, each `ok` line must not) and then checks the path scoping, which `--test` ignores. The bidi fixture is written at test time, so no committed file carries a bidi control character.

### SpotBugs: `spotbugs-check.sh`

SpotBugs 4.10.5 with the FindSecBugs 1.14.0 plugin on the compiled `org.chronitondb` classes, report only: findings are printed and never fail the check. Apache classes are read to resolve types and never analysed.

    tools/chronitondb/spotbugs-check.sh                 the classes under build/classes/main (run ant jar first)
    tools/chronitondb/spotbugs-check.sh CLASSES         the classes under another directory
    tools/chronitondb/spotbugs-check.sh --self-test     compile test/spotbugs and expect COMMAND_INJECTION and OBJECT_DESERIALIZATION

The jars come from Maven Central into `build/chronitondb-shape/spotbugs-4.10.5`, each refused unless its sha256 matches the pin in the script. The set is the `lib/` of the SpotBugs release, so `java -jar spotbugs.jar` finds them through its manifest.
